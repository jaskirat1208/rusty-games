 * N player game. Each player has K coins. Every player picks some coins out of k and pledges to put them on the table.
 * Before putting the coins on the table, each person makes an estimate on how many coins are on the table. 
 * If the person estimates correctly, he will get all the coins. The person who runs out of coins is out of the game permanently. 
 * The last person remaining wins :)
